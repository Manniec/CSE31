TPS Activity 2:
1.  .data marks declaring variables
    .word declares a size of memory to reserve (storage space) for array declarations
    .text start of main function (contains program code)
2.  branches if register $t3 and register $0 are equal, and if they are, it skips to label "finish:" at line 17
3.  jumps back to label "fib:" at line 10 (essentially loops back)
4.  Click on execute tab, click on checkbox under column "Bkpt" next to the row with the Source column element of line 15
5.  Green > arrow button runs line by line
6.  Registers tab on the right hand side of display. Double click on the value column for the resgister you want to change
7.  $t3, which is address 0x10010000. 233 is the fib (bc .word 15)
8.  reads the number in $v0 and outputs it in "Run I/O"
