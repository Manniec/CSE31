TPS activity 2:
1:  Open spotlight search and search terminal. (I have terminal saved on apps bar macbook)
    a:  Yes you can open more than one terminal at the same time
    b:  Opening one terminal at a time allows you to open programs and work on things while 
        having other things running or installing in the background, or to work on unrelated 
        tasks while keeping terminal commands and directorys open and accessible.
2:  type ls and it prints all files in the current directory
3:  cd and then the path to the desktop. For me: cd Desktop
4:  mkdir CSE31
6:  cd CSE31
    mkdir Lab_1

    https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Overall-Options.html#Overall-Options
3:  use command
        gcc main.c -o opt   
    to complile. 
4:  If there are errors it would come up in the terminal upon compiling
5:  -c allows you to compile and gives you the object file as an output, which is used 
    to make libraries 
6: -g is used for debugging
7: mv (executible_name) (cselab1)
8: if you compile running just gcc main.c, the executible is given as a.out
9: run the program by typing ./cselab1

TPS activity 4:
func main {
    int input = 1, sumPos, sumNeg, numPos, numNeg, ave_pos, ave_neg
    while (input is not 0){
        input = print("Please enter an integer:")
        if input > 0{
            increment sumPos by input
            increment numPos by 1
        }
        if input < 0{
            increment sumNeg by input
            increment numNeg by 1
        }
    } end while
    ave_pos = sumPos/numPos
    ave_neg = sumNeg/numNeg
    print (" Positive average: " + ave_pos)
    print (" Negative average: " + ave_neg)
}
