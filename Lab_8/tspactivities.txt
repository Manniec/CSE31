3.  Printing the string in the beginning 

    .data
    str1:	.asciiz "Please enter a number: " #declare the string

            .text
    main: 	la	$a0, str1	# set $a0 to string 
            li $v0, 4 	#string output syscall
            syscall

4.  Using syscall to read in an integer
    syscall 5 is for reading integers as inputs

    	li 	$v0,5       #string output syscall
		syscall
		move $t3,$v0    #save value in $v0 to $t3

5.  We no longer need to declare n, nor do we have to do the 
		la      $t3, n
		lw      $t3, 0($t3)
    step to load the value of n into the register $t3
